<summary> <font size="4"> Death Surrounded By Family, Slow, Expected.
</summary>
<p> The time has come. You have squared away your end of life plans and you are as ready as anyone could possibly be for death. As it approaches, your body loses its strength. You let out one last breath as your entire life comes to a slow and peaceful end. In this case, your brain is no longer receiving oxygen and it starts to die as well. The brain shuts down slowly, and studies show that brain activity spikes for a fleeting second. Perhaps you see your entire life flash before your eyes, or just your most favorite parts. Regardless, it isn't long before your brain starves. You're dead. </p>

<summary> <font size="4"> Sudden Death, Quick, Unexpected.
</summary> 
<p> No one expected this. In this case, your brain has sustained a massive injury; car accident, gunshot to the head, or a blunt force to the brain, a stroke, or even a brain bleed. At this point, it doesn't really matter and you have no way of thinking it over. The brain went first, and the body followed it in to the dark unknown of death. This is where you might be classified as "brain dead." Zero activity is occurring in your brain, and without the help of life saving measures, the rest of you goes with it. You're dead. </p> </details>

<h2> <center> Regardless of how you died, your brain has done the best job it could to keep you alive and healthy. No matter how you lived, you did so with the help of your brain, and your brain did so with the help of you. <br> You and your brain did a great job at being alive. <br> Whatever happened in life is over; it's time you rest now.
