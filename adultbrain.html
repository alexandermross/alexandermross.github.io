function myFunctionC() {
 confirm("A tumor can form within the brain. As this tumor grows, it creates a pressure. This pressure changes the function of the surrounding parts of the brain, which causes headaches and issues with balance. Some people have other symptoms like personality changes, poor communication, seizures. Some have all of these symptoms, other have none.");

Constant abuse can lead to mental health issues like paranoia, depression, anxiety, aggression, hallucinations, and other problems.");
