<br> <font size="4"> The brain is what makes you who you are. It is in charge of some of the most important day to day things, and whether or not it is able to develop healthily in pregnancy is far more crucial than one might think. The brain doesn't stop here; it continues developing until the age of 25!


<script>
function myFunction() {
 confirm("Yay! Your brain will healthily develop during the third week of gestation. By the ninth week, your brain will appear small and smooth!");
}


function myFunctionA() {
 confirm("It is super important for the pregnant person to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol consumption can expose the fetus to FASD, or Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. This can lead to problems with learning, behavioral issues, along with speech and language difficulties later in life.");
}

function myFunctionS() {
 confirm("Being exposed to nicotine during pregnancy is extremely dangerous. Smoking can cause tissue damage to the infant, partciularly to the lungs and the brain. Smoking is also be correlated with miscarriage and cleft lip.");
}

function myFunctionID() {
 confirm("This is extremely dangerous. Using illicit drugs can increase the pregnant person's risk of anemia, blood and heart infections, and the drug will almost always transfer over to the fetus, which can cause the fetus to be addicted to the illicit drug as soon as it is born, which increases the risk for sudden infant death syndrome.");
}

function myFunctionPRE() {
 confirm("A premature baby is always at a higher risk for sudden infant death syndrome. Studies show that preterm children have abnormally smaller brains in comparison to children carried to term. Studies also show that premature children have a higher risk of Cerebral palsy, problems with movement, posture, and balance.")
